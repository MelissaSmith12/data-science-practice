# This project will answer a number of analysis question surrounding the movement of 
# cards through a trello board that represents a semi-sequential process. Items are requested,
# developed, reviewed (which may contain multiple cycles), art provided, copy edited, entered 
# into to the system, checked, aligned, Senior Reviewed, post-Senior Reviewed, and have a final Review.
# This analysis seeks to ask the following questions: How long do cards stay in each phase? How many cycles
# does the average card go through? Are there any users at any stage in the process that are outliers?

# This project also provides an opportunity to play with APIs.
