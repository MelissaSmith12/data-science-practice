# practice-stuff

This repository is just a pile of small, unrelated beginner projects to refamiliarize myself with the language. I've set up a beeminder with the intent to log seven commits a week. 

In other words, nothing to see here. Move along.

yarn.r - This project describes uses the R yarn warp data set to perform some parctice with the dplyr package
careerWordCloud.R - plays around with script found on a blog script to generate word clouds based on script discovered in a blog post. Ultimately the word cloud was unsatifying, but it was a good introduction into Corpus - a data type that was new to me.
