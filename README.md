# practice-stuff

This repository is just a pile of small, unrelated beginner projects to refamiliarize myself with the language. I've set up a beeminder with the intent to log 21 commits a week. 

In other words, nothing to see here. Move along.

1. careerWordCloud.R - plays around with script found on a blog script to generate word clouds based on script discovered in a blog post. Ultimately the word cloud was unsatifying, but it was a good introduction into Corpus - a data type that was new to me.  
2. strengths.R - Processing keywords from strengths data gathering tasks from friends and coworkers, including summary chart of high-ranked keywords and a wordcloud  
3. Midpoint Webpage parsing.iypub - web scraping project to grab some data for music festival schedule planning
4. Data Nanodegree Assessment.iypub - assessment project for udacity nanodegree program. 
5. Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis-checkpoint.iypub - modification and exploration of existing code in Python for initial udacity project
6. Mumford and Sons Concert Scrape - uses lxml to scrape data off Mumford and Sons web page for a friend to use in Excel training class - left data a little dirty purposefully.
7. AO3 Search Rank - scrapes AO3 search results and applies a customized sort method to them
8. Beeminder API.R - initial playing around with R's API package, quickly abandoned - will use Python
