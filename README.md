# practice-stuff

This repository is just a pile of small, unrelated beginner projects to refamiliarize myself with the language. I've set up a beeminder with the intent to log seven commits a week. 

In other words, nothing to see here. Move along.

1. yarn.r - This project describes uses the R yarn warp data set to perform some parctice with the dplyr package  
2. careerWordCloud.R - plays around with script found on a blog script to generate word clouds based on script discovered in a blog post. Ultimately the word cloud was unsatifying, but it was a good introduction into Corpus - a data type that was new to me.  
3. AllItemProofing.R - Active project to apply dplyr and regular expressions to find problematic data. Catches known problematic inconsistencies in item metadata.
4. strengths.R - Processing keywords from strengths data gathering tasks from friends and coworkers, including summary chart of high-ranked keywords and a wordcloud  
5. AllItemSummary.R - Processes all item reports and generates a package of summary statistics. 
6. Midpoint Webpage parsing.iypub - web scraping project to grab some data for music festival schedule planning
7. Data Nanodegree Assessment.iypub - assessment project for udacity nanodegree program. 
8. Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis-checkpoint.iypub - modification and exploration of existing code in Python for initial project
9. FormatPushLists.vba - work project that cribbed code from vba macro to re-format set of spreadsheets for loading
10. LoadPushLists.vba - work project that loads a folder of push lists into access
