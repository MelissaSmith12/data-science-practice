# practice-stuff

This repository is collection of small, unrelated beginner projects I used to familiarize myself with R and Python. 

1. AO3 Search Rank.ipynb - This early experiment with web scraping interacts with the AO3 fan fiction website to apply an alternative sorting algorithm to web page results.
2. Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis-checkpoint.iypub - modification and exploration of existing code in Python for an initial Udacity project in their data analysis Nanodegree.
3. Data Nanodegree Assessment.iypub - assessment project for Udacity data analysis Nanodegree program. 
4. Mumford and Sons Concert Scrape.ipynb - uses lxml to scrape data off Mumford and Sons web page for a friend to use in Excel training class - left data a little dirty purposefully.
5. careerWordCloud.R - plays around with script found on a blog to generate word clouds. Ultimately the word cloud was unsatifying, but it was a good introduction into Corpus - a data type that was new to me.  
6. screen scrape http requests.ipynb - This was a simple update to a web exercise in Udacity. I've primarily kept it here as a quick reference for interacting with web forms to retrieve data when web scraping.
